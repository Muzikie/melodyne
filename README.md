Use the `./deploy.sh` file to automatically deploy a new version of each contract. The bash script will

 - Compile the changed files
 - Deploy the new version
 - Commit, tag and push the changes.
For example you can run:

```
sh deploy.sh V1 lisk-sepolia Melodyne
```
to deploy the first version of `Melodyne` on `lisk-sepolia`.

Note that the version number should include `V` followed by an integer.

## ðŸ§± Interactions
To test the interactions using the deployed version, there are scripts to perform all available actions. For example

```
NETWORK=lisk-sepolia npx hardhat run scripts/melodyneInteractions.js --network lisk-sepolia  
```

Remeber to pass the network value.
